# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
Calories Burnt Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts calories burned during physical activity using Python. It uses exercise and physiological data and applies regression techniques, mainly XGBoost Regressor, to deliver accurate calorie predictions.

In today’s health-conscious world, understanding how many calories you burn during workouts helps optimize fitness routines and improve wellness tracking. This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model that estimates calorie expenditure using features like:

Gender
Age
Height
Weight
Duration of exercise
Heart Rate
Body Temperature

The model analyzes these features and predicts the total calories burned during a workout session.
